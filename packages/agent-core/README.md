# @spirit-agent/core

TypeScript core runtime for [Spirit Agent](https://github.com/N123999/SpiritAgent) — the **single source of agent semantics** in the project. Desktop, CLI, and ACP hosts consume this package; they supply platform-specific execution and UI.

## What it provides

- **Turn machine** — streaming assistant output, tool rounds, compaction, and context usage tracking.
- **Agent / Plan / Ask modes** — full tool access, planning-only workflows, or read-only Q&A with edit tools stripped at the contract layer.
- **Subagents** — `run_subagent` delegates focused work to child runs with their own tool surface.
- **Model transports** — OpenAI-compatible, Open Responses, and Anthropic routes behind one runtime (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Anthropic, Google, Bedrock, Vertex, Gateway, OpenRouter, Alibaba, and others).
- **Host tool contracts** — built-in tools defined once (name, description, JSON Schema); hosts implement execution for workspace files, shell, web, delegation, planning, multimodal output, Dreams memory, and LSP diagnostics.
- **System context** — rules, skills, MCP client/registry, and mode prompts assembled for the model without duplicating tool lists in system text.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+
