# @spiritagent/server

**Spirit Server** — the shared daemon backend for [Spirit](https://github.com/SpiritAgents/SpiritAgent). It owns the agent runtime, sessions, streaming, tool execution, and approvals; hosts (CLI, Desktop, Web) attach as thin WebSocket clients instead of embedding a runtime in-process.

## What it provides

- **Daemon lifecycle** — binds `127.0.0.1` on an OS-assigned random port by default; writes `{ port, pid, startedAt, version }` to an instance registry so clients can attach instead of spawning duplicates.
- **WebSocket + JSON-RPC 2.0** — one transport for requests, responses, and server-initiated streaming notifications. No third-party dependencies; the RFC 6455 layer is implemented in-package.
- **Bearer auth** — a home-level token at `{spiritDataDir}/server.token` (mode 0600). Accepted via `Authorization: Bearer …` or a `?token=` query parameter (for browser clients that cannot set headers). `rotate-token` applies to new handshakes without a restart.
- **Instance management** — `ps` lists live instances (stale pids pruned), `kill` SIGTERMs one or all.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm run build
node dist/src/entry.js            # foreground daemon, random port
node dist/src/entry.js ps         # list instances
node dist/src/entry.js kill       # stop all instances
```

Or via the npm bin / Rust CLI wrapper:

```bash
spirit-server                     # same as `spirit-server serve`
spirit serve                      # Rust CLI spawns the same daemon
```

On startup the daemon logs the bound `ws://` URL, instance id, data dir, and token file path to **stderr**. The token itself is never printed — clients read it from the token file (same user, same home).

## Instance registry

Each daemon writes `{spiritDataDir}/server/instances/{instanceId}.json`:

```json
{
  "instanceId": "…",
  "pid": 12345,
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 51234,
  "startedAt": "2026-08-03T09:00:00.000Z",
  "version": "1.0.0-alpha.0"
}
```

Clients resolve a daemon by reading the registry, pruning records whose pid is dead, and attaching to a survivor — otherwise they spawn a new one. The registry lives in the shared Spirit data directory (`%APPDATA%/Spirit`, `~/Library/Application Support/Spirit`, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/Spirit`, or `~/.spirit-data`; override with `SPIRIT_DATA_DIR`).

## Protocol

After the upgrade handshake the server sends a `server.connected` notification (`protocolVersion`, `instanceId`, `version`).

**Server lifecycle**

| Method              | Kind         | Purpose                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `server.initialize` | request      | Client handshake: `clientKind` (`cli` / `desktop` / `web`), optional `clientId`, `workspaceRoot` |
| `server.health`     | request      | Liveness: pid, uptime, version, connection count                                                 |
| `server.connected`  | notification | First frame after a successful upgrade                                                           |

Notes for client authors:

- Events are **pushed**, not polled; each session runs a 25ms pump inside the daemon (the Desktop session-pump model) that drives `runtime.poll()` and harvests terminal results, so turns survive transient idle windows inside the turn machine (e.g. the await boundary while an approval resolves).
- `update-pending-assistant-thinking` carries the full accumulated thinking text (same contract as the legacy host bridge) — clients that want deltas must diff locally.
- `session.list` covers **live** sessions only. Desktop restores disk chats by creating a live daemon session and sending its archive; the daemon registry itself is not a disk-chat index.
- Multi-client: every connected client receives every session's events; filter by `sessionId`. When the **last** client disconnects, pending approvals are denied and pending questions skipped so no runtime parks forever.

## Remote access

Remote access is **off by default**: the daemon binds loopback and requires the home-level token. Passing `--hostname 0.0.0.0` exposes the LAN and is reserved for a future phase with explicit pairing; do not rely on it yet.

## Relationship to acp-server

`@spiritagent/acp-server` stays a separate stdio/ndJSON adapter for ACP editors. Spirit Server is the native hub for first-party clients; the two share `@spiritagent/agent-core` + `@spiritagent/host-internal` but no transport code.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24+
